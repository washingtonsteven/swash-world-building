# Crowstead

## Description

Crowstead is a sleepy New England town known for having many strange happenings, which, to be fair, is not unusual for the area.

Crowstead's strangeness circles around [[The Moon]], and the numerous sacrifices its inhabitants have made to it, whether willingly or not.

## Questions to Answer

- Okay so this is a cool setting. But what's the story here.
    - The Moon sacrifices have started suddenly, in the populated town, everyone is confused.
    - The town is empty, and someone stumbles across it
        - Perhaps people get lost there, a Bermuda Triangle type situation
