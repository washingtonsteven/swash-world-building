# Meet Ralph's

Living in the [[Crowstead (Town)|most haunted town]] in New England has its perks sometimes. I can't think of any right now, but I'm sure there are some sort of perks, else why would anyone live here? October is a free-for-all, tourists slamming the town for their Halloween goodies. They don't even know what goes on here the other 11 months of the year. I'm sure the Town Board is totally fine with it, however.

But it's May now and the town is sleepy as ever. The vacationers are out on the Cape instead of here, so I have free run of the town. It stands to reason, naturally, that I would spend my time in the parking lot of Ralph's Home Improvement.

Fun fact: The "Ralph" in "[[Marks' Home Improvement]]" is actually a last name. The store has been in the [[Marks Family]] since [[1883]], started by [[James Ralph]] and is son [[James Ralph II|James II]].

Currently, the store is run by [[Wynonna Marks]], who I've only met once or twice. But her daughter [[Crowstead/Chloe Marks|Chloe]] is a frequent customer of [[The Lonely Bean Club]], the coffee shop I work at. Or, well, used to.
