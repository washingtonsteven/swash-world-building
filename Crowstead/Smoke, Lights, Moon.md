# Smoke, Lights, Moon

Every day at nine o'clock PM [[Main Character|you]] smell smoke. 

The first time you smelled it, it was alarming. No alarms were going off, no fire trucks were arriving. What was on fire? "What's happening?" you would ask, frantically bounding about your house, trying to find the source of the smoke.

You stepped outside on that cold night, sheltered from the moonlight by a benevolent tree. There wasn't any wind, but the leaves were rustling all the same. In the distance you saw the [[Moonfire|light]], flickering in between branches of the heavily wooded, unsettled forest across the road. On the air floats a faint sound, and your chest beats with the rhythm of drums. You take a few more steps off your back porch, your bare feet sinking into the soft, damp earth. Grass tickles the top of your foot, or perhaps that was a centipede. Regardless, you pause halfway between your house and the edge of the woods, in a relatively open spot of the yard. You wouldn't dare step into the bare moonlight.

Opening your mouth, you croak out a "Hello?" at the flickering light. It was oscillating through several colors. Yes, there were reds and oranges and yellows like you would expect, but a deep  hunter green? A rich cobalt blue? A blinding light that seemed to overload your senses, seemingly incomprehensible, but the [[Moon's Mark|brand of an Unknown Symbol]] has now buried itself in your subconscious.

One more step. You see your skin glowing silver as [[The Moon|the moon]] looks down on you. Fear strikes your belly, and you look up to see the stars smiling, the moon's embrace.

You wake up the next morning, your face a bit more gaunt than it was before, your muscles a bit more stiff, your joints just ever so slightly more creaky. She doesn't need to take much, so long as there was plenty to take from.

This repeats itself on every night after a heavy rain. Smoke, lights, moon. Smoke, lights, moon. Smoke. Lights. Moon.

You eventually stop. You smell the smoke but have learned to resist its call. The dancing shadow and beating drums and otherworldly lights aren't worth it anymore. You used to have five fingers on each hand, now your left is down to four and a half. You have an eye appointment next week to get your prescription re-evaluated. You've gone through a bottle of ibuprofen twice as fast as you used to, and the pain yet still persists.

In the [[The Lonely Bean Club|Lonely Bean]], you chat with [[Crowstead/Chloe Marks|Chloe]]. You try to dodge asking about the occurrence outright, for fear of looking crazy. But she must have noticed the fact that you haven't been able to lift as many boxes, or stand at the register for as long. The shakiness with which you pour and serve, and the groans you make whenever you have to bend down into the case to get the last slice of coffee cake. Luckily, she starts it off.

"You doing okay?" She asks, her twang piercing your ears, surprisingly. She caught you as you were leaning on a while, scrolling through some form of hellsite on your phone. With a slightly pained grunt you push yourself off, standing on your own two feet, which immediately protest the action with a shot of pain up your legs. 

"Eh, been a bit rough." you shrug. "Maybe I just need to get more sleep."

She nods. "Be careful." she looks at you from over her glasses. "Some folk are saying [[The Moon|She]]'s been getting mighty greedy lately."

You furrow your brow. You haven't heard anyone talk about Her. At least not outside of your own thoughts. "'She'?" you repeat. 

Chloe casts her eyes upward in a quick glance, almost afraid to address Her directly, despite the fact that it was daytime and there was a ceiling in the way. "Yeah, you know." She leans in, continuing in a hushed tone. "Luna. The Moon. The Night Orb. You know." She reiterates. You, in fact, do not know, and your face seems to get that point across very succinctly.

"How long have you been living here?" she asks.

"A few weeks. Been working here for over a year, just decided to move closer. Well that and rent's been going up everywhere."

"I heard that" she crosses her arms. A customer walks up, and you step back to let her handle it, expecting the conversation to pause. It doesn't.

"You didn't skip [[Pamphlet - Welcome to Crowstead|the pamphlet]] did you?" She bagged up a muffin, and typed in an order for a coffee on the register. "The town makes sure everyone has one in their mailbox when they first move here."

"Pamphlet? Maybe." You shake your head. "I may have tossed it. You know, with the rest of the junk mail I get for moving somewhere."

She checks her watch as the customer finds a table, bringing out an e-book reader to skim as they sip their coffee. "Let me send you a copy. You really got to read that."

You're skeptical. "Is the pamphlet really going to have an answer to Her?"

"Oh, no one has that answer. But if you follow what it says it'll stop you from doing stupid shit like letting Her see you at night!"
