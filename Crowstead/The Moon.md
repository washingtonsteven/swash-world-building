# The Moon

It's the moon. But She's hungry. If you step into the unsheltered moonlight. She will take something from you. Usually it's a small bit of bodily functionality. Your eyesight will be slightly worse, your joints will ache a bit. Nothing you can't heal from, except from prolonged exposure.

She seems to use the stars as her minions, to do some of her dirty work.

She collects sacrifice from the inhabitants of [[Crowstead (Town)|Crowstead]] offered by [[The Old God]]. The ancient inhabitants of the area made an [[Ancient Pact]] with [[The Old God]] to help her woo the Moon.

It is unknown if she is alive and awake, or passive accepting these gifts.

Uses [[Moonfire]] to communicate, and the [[Moon's Mark]] to control.

It also creates a late-night television program (a la Local 58) (or is able to communicate with some other form of modern media).
