# Empire of Steel 

## Description

Yes, this is based on the song [Empire of Steel by Essenger (feat. Scandroid)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5ecQCbD5k)

The cool version is the [MASKED Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLUJuluKn9E)

Hopefully, an indictment of corporations' use of technology, but the way to fight back isn't by abandoning technology (and like living in the woods), but taking the technology back, and living alongside it and each other rather than using it as a tool of subjugation.

Also I want a human/robot romance.

Classic cyberpunk.

Can be a short Twine story.
