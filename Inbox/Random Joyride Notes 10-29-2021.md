## Secret War?
- Why are the Scientist so bent on expanding?
    - Secret other race that is trying to take over the galaxy as well?
    - Heading off an apocalypse?
    - Or causing one. The same thing that humans did, subsuming all life into one.

## Why would Navigators stay on planets?
- Collect extra data for bonus rewards
    - Do we want other rewards than just money?
- Do we actually want to implement a bounty system?
    - Since the fail condition is time, we'd have to implement a time system
        - So probably not.
        - Maybe get rid of the time aspect of bounties to not comfuse players
- Seeing cool things
    - Are ruins just everywhere?
    - What about barren planets?
    - Gaseous planets?
- Investigate scientific anomalies
    - i.e. Light/Dark Aether
    - All planets have something interesting about them?


"Here's 50 planets. 4 of them have story to discover, the rest of have a few fun things to find" (i.e. Mass Effect's Galaxy Map)

Why do we want to find the fun things?
- Extra ancient ones/Human lore
- Benefits in story missions
    - System upgrades
        - This involves more game elements. Combat?
    - Resources
        - Money
            - With nothing to spend it on, it sort of ends up like a score
            - Can a high score/money unlock some new things? Premium bounties? Ship upgrades that let you go to the far reaches? etc.
                - Need to get a good amount of money to really blow the story open.
        - Materials
        - What do we spend these on?
- Small side stories (think Rogue VI on Luna, ME2's Assignments)
- Do we need anything more than lore?
    - Reward for the diligent
    - i.e. Going straight through a normal game run, vs. getting extra clues to future installments if you look in every nook and cranny.
- metroidvania concepts
    - Portions of planets are inaccessible until you acquire/find/buy upgrades later, then come back.
