# Rainstorm

It was about a year ago today that David showed up in town. It was a clear night, moonlight bathing the streets, or so I'm told. I don't get to look at the moon anymore. Takes too much out of you.

Anyway, David rolled in his old jalopy, there wasn't any other word you could call it. It was an old pickup truck that sputtered and clanged, announcing itself as it rumbled down the street. Wooden planks in the truck bed clattered against each other. What's more, the clouds followed him. Deep silver, lined with white, the clouds blocked out the moon, a wave of darkness washing over the town. 

He drove right up to our house, which was closest to the square. We guess he knocked on our door because our lights were still on. I opened the inner door, leaving the screen door between us latched and closed. Can never be too careful.

"Well, hello there, sir." David spoke. He was young, dressed in a set of soaked overalls and a wool shirt underneath. Rain beaded on his brow, which wrinkled as he wiped the wetness from his eyes. "Any chance you know how to get to the center of town?"

It was 10:30 at night. Nothing was happening in the town center, at least not anything the residents were allowed to be privy to. Behind City Hall there was a sickly green aura that shone tonight, and every other Tuesday night, though we would never admit that. Still, we wanted to be hospitable, and directed him around the corner, and up the next hill. He'll run into the center soon enough.

"Thank you. You wouldn't happen to know about a carnival happening there, would you?"

We shook our head.

"Hm, I wonder if it's even still running this late at night." He looked around, jamming his hands in his pockets. He was under the porch roof, and seemed to be enjoying his time there. "And in this weather, to boot. Been raining for as long as I can remember."

We were grateful for rain, the cracked ground in the town was constantly begging, screaming for nourishment, and none of the citizens would dare volunteer, for fear that the earth would bite off more than she could chew.

David continued. "Would you mind helping me get there? I'm terrible with direction, and could use a copilot."

Our first instinct was to stay inside, where the Council promised to leave us alone. But there was something in his pathetic smile, a charm, a twinkle in his eye. Or maybe it was the light reflecting off the raindrops that enchanted us. Without much thought, we had shut the screen door behind us, and strode out to the run-down truck.

It only spun its wheels slightly in the mud, before gaining enough traction to get back out onto the road, where we directed him up toward the Centre, a circular plaza with the City Hall in the middle, flanked by businesses and restaurants, all encircling the Town Green. The rain fell like bullets, the lack of moonlight would make seeing the Shadow People of the Green terribly difficult.

That is, at least, if there weren't an active Carnival there.

Possibly set this in [[Crowstead Hub|Crowstead]]?
