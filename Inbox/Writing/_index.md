# Writing

This is where I'm going to put actual writing I'm doing.

In theory this should be it's own folder, outside of "Inbox," but I don't want this published on the site, and I don't feel like editing the site right now so here we go.

I can put random stories and stuff here. Though part of the thought is that some things will end up in the Settings. So I'd write them here, but then file them away with the setting. I think that makes sense.

I guess if I'm filing things away in other settings, it makes sense for this to be in Inbox. But I might make a "catch-all" setting for writing I want to "publish" but isn't connected to a setting. Or I can just make a setting with a single page. Who knows.
