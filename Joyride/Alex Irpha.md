# Alex Irpha

Alex is a [[Mirleon]], like [[Caleb Hertz|Caleb]]. They were brought in to the [[Thylacine Harpy Caravan]] after being rescued from their war-torn planet and abusive family.

Without a ship of their own, they stay with Caleb in their ship, the rest of the group figuring that Mirleons would work well together. This falls apart and Alex ends up rotating through the other Thylacine Harpy Caravan ships.
