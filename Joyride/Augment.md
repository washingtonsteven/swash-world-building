# Augment
An Augment (also **AugComm** short for Augmented Communicator) is a class of implanted device that can communicate and access various networks, social, and informational feeds. It can also access entertainment media.

As it is an implant, the software is fairly locked down. Some intrepid hackers have had some success in modifying the Augment's code, but this usually amounts ot literal brain surgery so not many have tried.

When in use, the users eyes glow white, as an indication that they are fully in the feed (i.e. VR). They can also operate in an augmented reality mode where only one eye if fully glowing. In either case, there are environmental warnings for the user to alert them to hazards in the real world.

An Augmented Communicator is a generic descriptor for a device (like "smartphone"). Several companies make their own Communicators with different features, quality, and reliability (like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, etc.)

They can interact with the interface via thought for most inbuilt programs. However the standard for third-party software is to interact via virtual keyboard, which appears for the user only (i.e. others watching will see the user typing at nothing).

Some high-end augments can also cause haptic sensations as well as control audiovisual centers of the brain, letting users see/feel/smell the virtual environment.
