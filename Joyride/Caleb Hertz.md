# Caleb Hertz

Caleb is a [[Mirleon]] from [[Ruzade]] and [[Nides]].

Somehow acquired a [[Class III Gridskipper]] (_[[The Opal Star]]_) and is hopping around the Galaxy with it. He dropped out of (work/school) and is about that nomad life.

He lived in a fancy community on [[Nides]].

## Background

His father, [[Caleb's dad]], was a worker down on [[Ruzade]], and he was born down there. He has little memories of the place, as when he was young his dad moved up to [[Nides]] on borrowed money, to make an easier life for Caleb. He worked as a [insert menial white collar task] and met [[Caleb's mom]], who soon got married when Caleb was younger than 4, barely able to remember a time before her.

She was overbearing about appearances, holding down a similar job which was barely enough for the three of them to scrape by on the fancy colony of [[Nides]]. [[Caleb's mom]] was forced to retire on disability, but [[Caleb's dad]] was able to get promoted, allowing them to continue, and even better, their lifestyle.

Occasionally, Caleb goes down to the planet with some schoolmates, and makes friends with some of the kids down there, but there's a consistent gap that keeps him from fully socializing there. Similar to up on Nides, where his lineage also keeps him feeling uncomfortable.
