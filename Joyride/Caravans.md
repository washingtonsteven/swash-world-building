# Caravans

A caravan is a group of people who have entered an agreement to fly together, for safety and companionship.

While they are not officially recognized public groups by the [[Joyride Government]], agreements on how caravans work are generally accepted by the public as a set of rules. 

These rules have been established by the [[Cross-Celestial Coalition]]\* (3C), a volunteer-led body to establish standards of caravans. They also operate the [[Caravan Registry]]

## Registration

When caravans are registered, a point of contact is provided, which usually ends up being the "leader" of the group (chairman, president, director, however the caravan wishes to acknowledge this). 

Usually caravans are named for their leader's ship, however custom names aren't uncommon.

("Item" is a weird description for this one)

\*This group should be similar in function as the W3C or similar.
