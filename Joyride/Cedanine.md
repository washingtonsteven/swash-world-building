# Cedanine

The Cedanine are an amphibious race. They have several tentacles that they can use to walk around on, growing more as they age. The elders typically use floating platforms to move around to help retain their moisture and prevent exhaustion from moving so many tentacles. The very young are entirely aquatic.

## Cedanine Homeworld

The Cedanine Homeworld is entirely covered in water. Though this was not always the case. It's said that a previous species attempted to terraform the planet, and an error caused all of sea levels to rise. This lead to either the death of that species, or their flight from the planet. This allowed the proto-Cedanine to evolve.
