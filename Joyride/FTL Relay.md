# FTL Relay

Not to completely steal everything from Mass Effect. But FTL travel in the Galaxy is achieved point-to-point, rather than ships having their own Lightspeed engines. This allows for easier jumps that don't requires flash-second timing and skills. AI that can do that are expensive and rarely not glitchy.

That said some ships can do FTL on their own. But those are the equivalent of superyachts or Lambos or something.
