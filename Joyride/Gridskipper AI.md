# Gridskipper AI

The AI that is installed in the [[Class III Gridskipper]]. Provides companionship (not like that, ew) when its user is alone in space.

It's possible to have the AI based on a personality. This could be based on a galactic celebrity, or even several that the user can switch between, based on whims (kind of like GPS voices).
