# Humans

Ancient Race that used to have a Galactic Empire. When the empire fell the memory of humanity died with it, save for a few ruins and artifacts strewn across the outer limits of their empire, which overlaps with [[Dreyyar Region]].

The center of their empire was the [[Sol System]].

It is said they exist among the nebulae, still living. (Maybe related to [[The Silver]]?)

## Ascension
At the peak of the [[Old Human Empire]], humans advanced enough to become incompatible with existence, and as such, disappeared. The mechanism of this is TBD.

Their influence (physical and, uh, mental?) is still felt on the universe, particularly the galaxy. Perhaps through the nebulae mentioned above. Definitely through random ruins and artifacts left on other planets (old cities, ancient rovers, would be cute if Perseverance was still kicking but that'd be a stretch).

Post-Ascension, they are known as the _Ascended Human Consciousness_. Which operates as a single being, the melding of all humanity into one. 

It's possible that [[Caleb Hertz|Caleb]] and [[Thylacine Harpy Caravan|friends]]' exploits start peeling out individuals from the consciousness, threatening a collapse into existence.
