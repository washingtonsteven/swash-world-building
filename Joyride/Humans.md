# Humans

Ancient Race that used to have a Galactic Empire. When the empire fell the memory of humanity died with it, save for a few ruins and artifacts strewn across the outer limits of their empire, which overlaps with [[Dreyyar Region]].

The center of their empire was the [[Sol System]].

It is said they exist among the nebulae, still living. (Maybe related to [[The Silver]]?)
