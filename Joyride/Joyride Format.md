# Joyride Format

Stories here will be written in Twine/Twee. As a series of episodic "chapters." This may end up being separate Twine stories, or separate chunks within Twine (or using uncludes if using Twee).

## Choices
Choices should be important or exploratory. 

- Important choices
    - Choices that affect stats, world state, immediate responses, or branching paths
- Exploratory
    - Moving to relevant places.
        - Avoid having "empty" spaces that the player must "move through."

### Lessons learned from 'Bunker'
1. Don't have choices for the sake of choices
    1. i.e. "turning on GPS" Like. What was that.
2. Don't have empty, unimportant navigation that's more "realistic"
    1. There was no reason to have separate entries for each of the "blocks" when there was nothing there. The fact that you walked past a Taco Bell wasn't important enough to actually write about it. Or at least not have a whole passage dedicated to it.
3. Locations should always be relevant
    1. No need to spend energy on locations that add flavor to the world
    2. This rule is probably the first to break, since world flavor is always nice
        1. But it can sort of get in the way of story progress, which messes with player flow and, honestly, writer flow.

## Old Notes
I do want this to eventually be interactive, either as a narrative or a full-on game. Decisions to travel to planets and explore them will be up to the reader/player.

I also sort of want to write in a way where I'm exploring the galaxy as I'm writing it, sort of making things up by the seat of my pants. But then will I have to go back and edit? Am I okay with getting trapped in a snap decision I made that is difficult to write myself out of?

> ðŸ’¡ Initially, I don't think it's helpful to try to make the game and write it at the same time. But maybe I can do something like a script, or like cutscene descriptions on Ishtar Collective ([example: The Technocrat Mission Transcript](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/transcripts/empire-hunt-the-technocrat)).
> This is something I can then a) write right here in Obsidian, and b) more easily translate into something that can either be visually represented in a game, or be turned into more formal prose for an IF game or even a more linear story, if I want.

### Exploration

Inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/alyssavisscher/status/1412170487933784078): The Dora Method of exploring in D&D, i.e. Forest, Bridge, Mountain.

Can be switched up with not getting all three steps at a time. i.e. First you get directed to the Forest. In the forest you find a clue to lead you to the Bridge, and at the Bridge you get a clue to lead you to the Mountain.

There's also the idea of pseudo-linearity and directed exploring. Instead of just having the whole world opened up to you, you get specific directions in the world, but the freedom to go down other paths. Bonus would be having those other paths be meaningful to the world but require little deviance from the main path.

Example, Mass Effect (cause I'm playing it now): You get a mission, which directs you to a specific cluster/system. There are 5-8 planets in that system, but only one of them can be landed on, that's your destination. But you get to "explore" the other planets for blurbs and can survey for collectables. Still gives the feeling of exploring an entire system without spending lots of time on side paths that don't have to do with your mission directly.

Then even on the planet, you get waypoints to points of interest, to help guide your exploration. You're still free to wander around the whole planet (and are rewarded for doing so in the form of minerals which aren't marked as waypoints). All exploration feels directed and less wandering, but still somewhat steers away from linearity.

#### Locations

I think the locations don't have to be planets, specifically, if we are going to steal stuff from Mass Effect. I think it would work well to have them be Space Stations. It's hard to think of what a planet that isn't Earth would be, without falling into the trope of the entire planet being homogeneous. Would nations form? Separate states? What about sorts of alliances? Large swaths of empty land to pillage for resources, rather than use up with housing? Ooo that sounds chilling when I put it that way. Like how would industry have changed on Earth if we were 70 million and not 7 billion?
