## Description

[[Caleb Hertz]] gets access to an inter (intra?) galactic ship, and uses it to explore the galaxy. The ship needs upgrades to increase the range (as a method of limiting where you can go and not overwhelm the player with the whole galaxy at once).

He meets others and forms friendships with them. Some of them join him on his journey, but others stay behind and keep in contact via email.
