## Description

[[Caleb Hertz]] gets access to an inter (intra?) galactic ship, and uses it to explore the galaxy. The ship needs upgrades to increase the range (as a method of limiting where you can go and not overwhelm the player with the whole galaxy at once).

He meets others and forms friendships with them. Some of them join him on his journey, but others stay behind and keep in contact via email.

Could possibly steal points from [[The Moon]] and [[The Old God]] from [[Crowstead Hub|Crowstead]] to have a stakes plot. Like the Moon is seen as a villain but its revealed that the old god was made of dark matter and was sacrificing things to her?

## Outline

- Intro to [[Caleb Hertz|Caleb]] and [[The Opal Star]]
- First few worlds of exploration
    - What do we do here? Random tasks for people? Uncovering artifacts? Meeting people and learning about the galaxy.
    - Gather a few bits of the fam.
    - These can be wild and crazy, think of hopping between train cars in Infinity Train.
- Find first "big plot" artifact, and an upgrade for the ship
    - Now we can travel to more worlds
    - This happens after accidentally hitting an FTL Relay
- Rinse and repeat until the mystery is solved.
    - Eventually gain the ability to "Dream Hop"
        - This is either literally travelling in people's thoughts and dreams, or a figurative hop into an alternate dimension to see things from a new perspective
        - Hop into the memory of a human??

This is an extremely basic outline

### What is "The Big Plot"

I want it to be something about the progenitors of the galaxy, a lost race of people who left clues about their existence and their extinction.

This happens a lot in other sci-fi bits as human discovering some wise old race, and particularly that race forming and shaping humanity from the start, back in the Neanderthal days.

(ex. Mass Effect > Protheans, Halo > Forerunner, MCU/Agents of SHIELD > Kree)

Would it be an interesting twist to have the wise yet extinct race be humans? This is many thousands of years in the future, and the Galactic Terran Empire is but ruins and legend. Splatoon did this a bit, with the world set in the future after climate changed ruined things for people. I don't know if I want to go into the "humans are inherently bad and brought about their own doom" approach here. Perhaps that can be a part of it, and perhaps that was the reason the Empire fell and humans were wiped out. But what was left, what truly lasted, wasn't generals and war and hatred and bloodshed, but a yearning to last, to help, to be remembered, a fear of being lost forever. Maybe its altruistic, but it can also be entirely selfish. Like forming a parasocial relationship across millennia.

Even if there aren't physical artifacts or evidence of physical interaction between humans and the new galaxy races...even just influencing culture and myths and ideas would be good enough. Think like the Asgardians vs Norway in the MCU.

### Old Human Empire

The Old Human Empire (with Sol/Earth at the center), slightly overlaps the outskirts of the current Empire/Governing Area (should make a page for that). Sol/Earth is outside of the Governing Area, but the far reaches of the Empire overlap with the Governing Area, meaning that human artifacts aren't too outlandish to find.

### Goals

Goal, reestablish the human empire? Keep the humans from rising again? Finding artifacts that justify humanity's damnation or salvation, i.e. learning only one side of humans. are you looking for artifacts that confirm your preconceived notions? self fulfilling prophecy?

## Format

I do want this to eventually be interactive, either as a narrative or a full-on game. Decisions to travel to planets and explore them will be up to the reader/player.

I also sort of want to write in a way where I'm exploring the galaxy as I'm writing it, sort of making things up by the seat of my pants. But then will I have to go back and edit? Am I okay with getting trapped in a snap decision I made that is difficult to write myself out of?

> ðŸ’¡ Initially, I don't think it's helpful to try to make the game and write it at the same time. But maybe I can do something like a script, or like cutscene descriptions on Ishtar Collective ([example: The Technocrat Mission Transcript](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/transcripts/empire-hunt-the-technocrat)).
> This is something I can then a) write right here in Obsidian, and b) more easily translate into something that can either be visually represented in a game, or be turned into more formal prose for an IF game or even a more linear story, if I want.

### Exploration

Inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/alyssavisscher/status/1412170487933784078): The Dora Method of exploring in D&D, i.e. Forest, Bridge, Mountain.

Can be switched up with not getting all three steps at a time. i.e. First you get directed to the Forest. In the forest you find a clue to lead you to the Bridge, and at the Bridge you get a clue to lead you to the Mountain.

There's also the idea of pseudo-linearity and directed exploring. Instead of just having the whole world opened up to you, you get specific directions in the world, but the freedom to go down other paths. Bonus would be having those other paths be meaningful to the world but require little deviance from the main path.

Example, Mass Effect (cause I'm playing it now): You get a mission, which directs you to a specific cluster/system. There are 5-8 planets in that system, but only one of them can be landed on, that's your destination. But you get to "explore" the other planets for blurbs and can survey for collectables. Still gives the feeling of exploring an entire system without spending lots of time on side paths that don't have to do with your mission directly.

Then even on the planet, you get waypoints to points of interest, to help guide your exploration. You're still free to wander around the whole planet (and are rewarded for doing so in the form of minerals which aren't marked as waypoints). All exploration feels directed and less wandering, but still somewhat steers away from linearity.

#### Locations

I think the locations don't have to be planets, specifically, if we are going to steal stuff from Mass Effect. I think it would work well to have them be Space Stations. It's hard to think of what a planet that isn't Earth would be, without falling into the trope of the entire planet being homogeneous. Would nations form? Separate states? What about sorts of alliances? Large swaths of empty land to pillage for resources, rather than use up with housing? Ooo that sounds chilling when I put it that way. Like how would industry have changed on Earth if we were 70 million and not 7 billion?
