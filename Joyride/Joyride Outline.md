# Joyride Outline

- Intro to [[Caleb Hertz|Caleb]] and [[The Opal Star]]
    - Also the [[Thylacine Harpy Caravan]]
    - On a Hub Station ([[Juno Terminal]]), Caleb meets the Caravan while getting bounties.
        - Conversation with [[Mora Evelu|Mora]].
            - Player can pretend they've gotten bounties before, Mora calls them out
            - Or play it straight as a newbie
- First few worlds of exploration
    - What do we do here? Random tasks for people? Uncovering artifacts? Meeting people and learning about the galaxy.
        - ðŸ’¡ The [[Scientists]] have been uncovering new worlds, expanding outside of their little corner of the galaxy. While they are able to discover things about planets through spectroscopy and distanced observations, there's nothing like boots-on-ground reconnisance. The Scientists use their observations to find obviously inhospitable planets and build rovers and unmanned drones there, but for near-habitable planets, they offer bounties for [[Navigators]] to go, piggyback on their ship's systems, and collect info about planets that they land on. Think SETI@Home irl.
        - These bounties are sent out on the [[Planetary Beacon Bounty Board (PB3)]]
    - These can be wild and crazy, think of hopping between train cars in Infinity Train.
- Find first Human artifact, and an upgrade for the ship
    - Now we can travel to more worlds
    - This happens after accidentally hitting an FTL Hole
- Rinse and repeat until the mystery is solved.
    - Eventually gain the ability to "Dream Hop"
        - This is either literally travelling in people's thoughts and dreams, or a figurative hop into an alternate dimension to see things from a new perspective
        - Hop into the memory of a human??
        - I'm adding this because it's cool, not because it makes sense.


## Side Plots
### Abandoned Colonies
The [[Thylacine Harpy Caravan]] find an abandoned colony, the ruins are unrecognizable. They eventually discover a secret [[Joyride Government]] plot to hide something about these colonies. Seeeecret knowledge.

### What happened on the [[Eon Rapture]]
After [[Xana Lamier]] is rescued, the gang and [[Eon]] attempt to find out what happened, and why Xana was there in the first place.

### [[Alex Irpha|Alex's]] History
"Adopting" Alex from their home would lead to potential prying or eventual admission/working through their past and what brought them to this point.


## Old Notes
### The Cosmic Spark
This is the thing that sort of elevates the story of Caleb and the rest of the [[Thylacine Harpy Caravan]] to galactic, existential stakes.

<details>
<summary>Stream of Consciousness Notes</summary>
I want it to be something about the progenitors of the galaxy, a lost race of people who left clues about their existence and their extinction.

This happens a lot in other sci-fi bits as human discovering some wise old race, and particularly that race forming and shaping humanity from the start, back in the Neanderthal days.

Would it be an interesting twist to have the wise yet extinct race be humans? This is many thousands of years in the future, and the Galactic Terran Empire is but ruins and legend. Splatoon did this a bit, with the world set in the future after climate changed ruined things for people. I don't know if I want to go into the "humans are inherently bad and brought about their own doom" approach here. Perhaps that can be a part of it, and perhaps that was the reason the Empire fell and humans were wiped out. But what was left, what truly lasted, wasn't generals and war and hatred and bloodshed, but a yearning to last, to help, to be remembered, a fear of being lost forever. Maybe its altruistic, but it can also be entirely selfish. Like forming a parasocial relationship across millennia.

Even if there aren't physical artifacts or evidence of physical interaction between humans and the new galaxy races...even just influencing culture and myths and ideas would be good enough.

### Old Human Empire
The Old Human Empire (with Sol/Earth at the center), slightly overlaps the outskirts of the current Empire/Governing Area (should make a page for that). Sol/Earth is outside of the Governing Area, but the far reaches of the Empire overlap with the Governing Area, meaning that human artifacts aren't too outlandish to find.

### Ascension
Humanity was wiped out by the universe. As in, while humanity rose from the universe itself, they transcended existence, and were rendered incompatible with space and time, hence their sudden disappearance.

This [[Humans#Ascension|Ascended Human Consciousness]] now no longer exists in space and time, but outside of it, as much as the word "exists" can apply to them.

Was this a good thing? Are the current societies heading to that point? 

This would leave human influences/ruins/artifacts in the galaxy. 

### Post-Ascension Dissonance
Perhaps there are a group of humans who have separated from the Ascended Consciousness in order to find a way back to existence. This could be the ultimate afterlife describe by Heaven and Hell (or other post-life stories from other cultures that unfortunately I am less familiar with). While some find it to be calming and a paradise, others crave existence. Some feel trapped, and simply try to prevent others from following in their footsteps. Others are trying to forcibly rend the barrier between existence and non to return.
