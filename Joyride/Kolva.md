# Kolva

Kolva are four-legged creatures, with a torso placed perpendicularly to the rest of their body (similar to centaurs). Their legs are furred and muscular, and come in a number of patterns and colors, not to mention that dying the fur and adorning their legs with jewelery is a popular form of self-expression among them.
