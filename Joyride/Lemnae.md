# Lemnae

The Lemnae are four-legged beasts, originally known for their prowess and brutality in war. They were somewhat forced to leave behind their ways to receive assistance from the [[Joyride Government]], and retain diplomatic relations with the other species. There are some pockets of Lemnae society that attempt to keep their warrior spirit alive, though these are quickly branded as heretics and occasionally terrorists.
