# Mirleon

This is the species that [[Caleb Hertz|Caleb]] is.

Lizard/Dragon influences.

They are [ectothermic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectotherm) meaning that they regulate their body temperature through external means. Most use [[Mirleon endosuit]]s to manage this in most environments. Extreme cold would cause the Mirleon to become lethargic, sleep or hibernate, or possibly die (though could be revived with warmth if it hasn't been too long since "death"). Heat will cause the Mirleon to be hyperactive, which is also counter intuitive as their system could easily overload with the extra mechanical energy output.
