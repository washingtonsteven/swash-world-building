# Mora Evelu

Mora is a [[Lemnae]] who meets [[Caleb Hertz|Caleb]] at his first stop on [[Juno Terminal]].

Mora is older than [[Caleb Hertz|Caleb]] by a bit, easily fitting into a big sister/protector role (i.e. not quite old enough to be his mother).

She is a part of [[Thylacine Harpy Caravan|a small caravan]] that takes Caleb in.
