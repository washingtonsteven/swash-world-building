# Navigators

The collective name for people who are licensed to fly in the [[Dreyyar Region]].

They are usually part of [[Caravans]], which are governed (sorta), by the [[Cross-Celestial Coalition]].

Should be something cool but not super ridiculous. Tbh "Pilots" isn't bad. But something like "spacer"? But not "spacer." Idk.

## Ranks

There are ranks of Navigator, indicating a combination of time in role as well as exceptional performance

### Tenure Ranks

These ranks are automatically awarded by the [[Cross-Celestial Coalition]] upon keeping one's Navigator membership up to date. Lapsed memberships are paused. Extremely lapsed memberships are demoted.

### Experience Badges

These ranks are awarded Navigator-to-Navigator, as a way of recognizing skill or ability. At first, anyone could make and award a badge (as they were applied to the Navigator Digital Profile). However, The [[Cross-Celestial Coalition]] stepped in to establish a set of "official" badges only to be awarded by them or a representative. These are the most rare and sought after.

#### IRL Note

Yes I am basing these on badges from work. Try and stop me.
