# Nides

(pronounced _needs_)

This is the moon where [[Caleb Hertz|Caleb]] grew up. The entire moon is kind of one large suburb, all residential. There are a few commercial pockets for trade, like strip malls.

It is incredibly dull there, most of the excitement happens on the main planet [[Ruzade]]

## IRL

This seems to mean "a nest or brood of pheasants." So that's something.
