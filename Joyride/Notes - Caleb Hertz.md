# Notes: Caleb Hertz
<!-- notes are in ""**{DATE}**\nNotes content, likely in bullets" format. Most recent at top -->

## Original Notes
<!-- These are notes from before I switched to talk pages -->

> ðŸ’¡ This could be the Player Character, and thus the player names him, and likely the gender as well. Which complicates writing only a bit. The game implementation is what really gets weird.
> Everything else here can be canon, but the name would be customizable.
> Maybe species and backstory if there's time/I'm feeling more ambitious. I don't think that's a good idea for the first outing though.

### Background

> ðŸ’¡ This should consider why Caleb is leaving his home. Dead parents? Orphan? Why does he need to get found family? Is his family just awkwardly estranged? We can get autobiographical on this but tbh that's scawwy.
> Estranged from parents? Dead? Why need found family? Ostracized? no family because orphan? Created in a lab?

> ðŸ’¡ NB: The Background below is old and I don't really like it, just keeping it around in case I want to steal anything from it and don't feel like digging through git to get to it.
> (This is in reference to the Background about Caleb's Father being a worker and mother being a high class business woman)

### Questions
- How did he get it? (The Ship)
    - Purchase? Stolen? Gifted?
