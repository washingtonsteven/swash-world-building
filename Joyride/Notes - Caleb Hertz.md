# Notes: Caleb Hertz
<!-- notes are in ""**{DATE}**\nNotes content, likely in bullets" format. Most recent at top -->

**2021-09-25**
- What does Caleb want?
    - Independence? Proving himself? Breathing room?
    - Phrased differently, why did Caleb apply to become a Navigator?
    - Running away from something?
        - Family? They seem supportive.
            - Stuck under their shadow? They are notorious (e.g. Oil executives or something)
            - Learning to recognize privilege (and the intersectionality of it) and use that for good.
        - Weird Ex/Stalker?
        - Legal Troubles?
    - Role Model/TV Character? "I wanna be like [Buzz Lightyear] or whatever"
    - Pressganged into it?
        - Alternatively, it's either Navigate or starve.
    - **Already found a human artifact, looking for more?**
        - i.e. Curiosity, even unto the last breath.
            - Curiosity that is not fully his own? The artifact *wants* to be found.
            - _Self-destructive?_
                - Unknowing of his effects on others, willing to throw himself away 
                    - To be remembered. To make a big discovery and get known and never "die" as long as he's in a history book.
                - Never known true hardship. "How bad could it be" sort of outlook.
                    - Unknownling endangering others.
    - **Contracted?**
        - Overselling himself, taking on more than he can chew.
- How does he want it?
    - Is it bad to want what he wants
    - A character can either a) want something bad or b) want something good, but plans to go about it in a bad way. Both leave an opportunity for the character to instead want to do something good the good way. That journey would be the character arc
        - "good" and "bad" are subjective in the above paragraph.

## Original Notes
<!-- These are notes from before I switched to talk pages -->

> ðŸ’¡ This could be the Player Character, and thus the player names him, and likely the gender as well. Which complicates writing only a bit. The game implementation is what really gets weird.
> Everything else here can be canon, but the name would be customizable.
> Maybe species and backstory if there's time/I'm feeling more ambitious. I don't think that's a good idea for the first outing though.

### Background

> ðŸ’¡ This should consider why Caleb is leaving his home. Dead parents? Orphan? Why does he need to get found family? Is his family just awkwardly estranged? We can get autobiographical on this but tbh that's scawwy.
> Estranged from parents? Dead? Why need found family? Ostracized? no family because orphan? Created in a lab?

> ðŸ’¡ NB: The Background below is old and I don't really like it, just keeping it around in case I want to steal anything from it and don't feel like digging through git to get to it.
> (This is in reference to the Background about Caleb's Father being a worker and mother being a high class business woman)

### Questions
- How did he get it? (The Ship)
    - Purchase? Stolen? Gifted?
