# Notes: The Silver

**2021-09-04**
These are possibly related to Humans, could be actual humans attempting to communicate from outside their [[Humans#Ascension]].

## Original Notes

Why do they still have bodies, why do they still interact with organics?

(Related to [[Thonics]]? [[Humans]]? Both?)
