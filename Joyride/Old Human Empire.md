# Old Human Empire

The region of the galaxy that the ancient humans had spread their influence to, with the [[Sol System]] and [[Earth]] at the center.

The heart of the human empire (Sol) is in the [[Andotha Region]] of the galaxy, but its antiquated borders overlap with that of the [[Dreyyar Region]].
