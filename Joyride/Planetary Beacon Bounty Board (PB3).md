# Planetary Beacon Bounty Board (PB3)
This is a digital board of celestial bodies that the [[Scientists]] have curated in order to reward exploration of the planet.

## Bounty Info
Each bounty contains the following information:

- Body Designation
    - The "name" of the body. Usually a scientific jumble of letters and numbers
- Coordinates
    - Where to find it. For well-tracked bodies, these will update as the body moves through space. Other bodies will be given a probability volume to search for the body in.
- Claim Fee
    - The cost to the claimant in order to reserve the fee for themselves
- Claim date
    - When the bounty was last claimed
- Claim History
    - List of previous (failed) claimants of this bounty
- Return window
    - How much time from the claim date the bounty must be turned in.
- Return penalty
    - Failure to turn in the bounty within the Return window will refund the Claim Fee, minus this percentage
- Reward / Turn-in code
    - The reward (in credits), and the code to use to verify that the beacons have been placed.
- Bounty ID code
    - A unique code per-bounty. Can be traced back to an individual [[Scientists#Houses|House]].
- Additional Notes

## Claiming Bounties
Bounties are claimed via a fee. Once the fee has been paid, the bounty may not be bought again.

Each bounty has a Return window. The bounty must be completed and turned in by this date. If not, the claim fee is returned to the claimant, minus the percentage listed in the Return penalty. (e.g. A 100cr bounty with a 50% Return penalty will return 50cr when the Return window has passed).

If a bounty has been failed, this will be noted in the bounty's claim history and will return "to the market."

## Accessing the Bounty Board
The Bounty Board is digitally available wherever access to the [[Dreyyar Region#Network|Network]] is available.

Additionally, there are certain Network personalities that make a living getting views on their Bounty Review shows and/or articles, hilighting potentially high profit bounties. Some of these [[Scientists#Bounty Reviewers|Reviewers]] work for the [[Scientists]], or at least are sponsored by/receive kickbacks from them for every bounty they had a hand in selling.
