# Rhea Zelais

Rhea is a [[Kolva]] that is a part of the [[Thylacine Harpy Caravan]].

She is much older than the rest of the crew, having had many children who have grown up on their own and had their own children. She navigates in lieu of doing nothing in her older age, something that is not uncommon for other [[Kolva]].
