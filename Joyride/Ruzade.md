# Ruzade

Planet in the [[Initial Joyride System]]. It has one occupied moon: [[Nides]], which is the main, well-to-do residential area.

Most of the planet is uninhabitable, but there is a terraformed portion of a continent where industry occurs. Naturally this is also where slums tend to be.

In recent years it has been trendy to move into the slum areas, fixing them up to make them "boho-chic" or whatever. You know, standard gentrification. However the people on [[Nides]] don't want the poors from the planet moving in with them, so the city continues to expand into less and less safe areas where, you guessed it, the poor end up.
