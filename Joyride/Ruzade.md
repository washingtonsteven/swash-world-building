# Ruzade

Planet in the [[Initial Joyride System]]. It has one occupied moon: [[Nides]], which is the main, well-to-do residential area.

Most of the planet is uninhabitable, but there is a terraformed portion of a continent where industry occurs. Naturally this is also where slums tend to be.

In recent years it has been trendy to move into the slum areas, fixing them up to make them "boho-chic," causing widespread gentrification.  However, the people on [[Nides]] do not allow the original Ruzade inhabitants from the planet moving up to the moon, so the city continues to expand into less and less safe areas where, with the poorest among the citizens forced to the dangerous outskirts.
