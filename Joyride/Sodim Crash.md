# Sodim Crash

Sodim is a member of the [[Cedanine]], and trained in the Cedanine Military Strategy School. He was dishonorably discharged when he no longer wished to participate in the Cedanine's military operations (which are TBD but are generally bad and unfair and destructive to lower/weaker classes), despite participating the military being a lifelong dream for him.

He is quite a hardass, always focused on getting the next task done, and barely makes time to socialize.
