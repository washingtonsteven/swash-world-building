# First Bounty

:: Start
You stare up at the bright board in the middle of the bustling Transit Hub. Clutching your single slingbag, nervousness runs through you. Everything here was so much more than you were expecting, and you were expecting a lot. You feel your scaled skin flush from a speckled white down to a steely blue, a shiver running up your spine.

The board occasionally cycled through depatures and arrivals through the six wings of the station, but those weren't what you were looking for, at least not yet.

You reach into an outer pocket of your bag, pulling out a flat computer. The brand name [[VertexSlate]] flashed on the screen, before resuming where you left off: the acceptance packet from the [[Scientists|Terra Mesmer]] for your [[Navigators|Navigator]] application.

```
Congratulations!

You may report to the nearest Bounty Board to pick up your initial license and receive an in-person training. We simply ask that you schedule this visit ahead of time to ensure a representative will be available to meet you.

Given your information, the nearest Bounty Board to you is on: Juno Station, wing 5S.

If you do not schedule your initial training within 15 cycles, this acceptance packet will be forfeit. You may not re-apply for Navigator status for an additional 150 cycles.
```

You repeat the location to yourself, Wing 5S. Now, where the heck is that?
