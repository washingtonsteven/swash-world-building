# Missed Call

[[Caleb Hertz|Caleb]] woke up to a soft beeping at the [[The Opal Star|cockpit]]. He groggily adjusted himself, rotating on his side in an attempt to ignore it. Then, like lightning, the realization struck him.

"Shit!" he shout-whispered, for the benefit of no-one else on his single-occupancy craft. He shot out of bed, swinging down from the top bunk, deftly avoiding pipes, kicking off the lower bunk that served as his desk before rocketing up the ladder to answer the beeping.

"Hello? Hi."

Silence. Followed by a furrowed brow.

"Hello?" he repeated, jamming onto the answer toggle a few times to make sure it activated.

More silence.

Caleb sighed, sinking back into the pilot chair. He closed his eyes for a moment, then turned to look at the clock to his right. Only 3 hours of sleep. Regardless he started his "morning" routine. Restling up some grounds for [[Joyride coffee substitute]] and beginning the brew. Then he flipped through some feeds, checking on what's been going on in [[Dreyyar Region|Dreyyar]]. 

Not much, it turned out. Celebration was sweeping over the Dreyyar systems in honor of [[Joyride national holiday]], most governments were closed for the next cycle or two. Trades were paused. Restaurants were running specials. Ship dealers were having grand 80% off sales (after hiking pricess 200% the previous week, that is).

Another set of beeps lit up his console, different than earlier. These were more harsh, urgent. He reached behind him to grab his [[Joyride personal tablet]] swiping on the screen to open a call with [[Mora Evelu|Mora]].

"You up already?" she sounded out of breath.

"Yeah, just missed a call."

"Oof. That sucks."

"Eh." Caleb shrugged. "There will be more."

"All the more reason for you to continue to hang with us." she panted.

"Yeah..." he trailed off. "You doing alright? You're up early too."

"Up _late_, thank you very much."

"Fine. But what are you up to?"

"Treadmill. Got ansty after sitting around with netgames all night. Gotta burn off some energy so I can get to sleep."

"Fair enough."

"Holiday tomorrow. Well, today I guess." a few beeps came from Mora's end, and Caleb only just not noticed that there was mechanical whirring in the background as it slowed to a stop. "No reason to be up and at 'em at the crack of it."

"Yeah. I might head off to [[Epsilon Terminal|Epsil]] to get a refill of [[Joyride coffee substitute]]. See some sights other than the black."

"You got tired of that real quick, didn't you?"
