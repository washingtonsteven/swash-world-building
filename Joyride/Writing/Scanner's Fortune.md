# Scanner's Fortune

> ðŸ¤” Gonna try second person in this one.

You land your ship at the edge of the landing zone marked by the other skippers in the _[[Thylacine Harpy]]_ caravan. Despite being the last to land, you're the first to get out and get off the platform.

This world is dry and just..._brown_. Disgustingly so. The air is still, for now at least. Despite the local star shining bright in the sky, you feel a distinct chill before your [[Mirleon endosuit|endosuit]] compensates for the low temperatures. Even though it kicked in fairly quickly, the feeling of lethargy kicked in fast. You have your [ectothermy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectotherm) to thank for that.

Close behind you followed [[Mora Evelu|Mora]], padding on all fours. Her full-body fur kept her warm, though it was fluffed out more than usual to compensate for the cold. She spoke up.

"I don't know what your scanners picked up." She said. "I hope it's worth all this cold. Alex has to stay back since their [[Mirleon endosuit|endosuit]] still needs some repairs."

You still have trouble believing that Mora missed the massive ping on the scanners. Your system wasn't able to identify what the material was, thought its spectroscopic sensors _were_ on the fritz lately. Figuring that such a massive signature was worth a closer look, you nod to Mora.

"Not a problem. We probably just need to scout things out on this run. Get a sense for the haul, you know?"

A softer voice popped up from behind. "And if anyone is trying to beat us there." [[Rhea Zelais|Rhea]] plodded over, her heavy frame shaking the stone beneath them. "We should be cautious."

You brandish your [[Joyride pistol|pistol]], flashing a grin. "That's what we have these for!"

"That peashooter may have scared some folks back on [[Nides]]." Mora began to warn. "But if we run into pirates..."

"We run the other way, I know I know." You nod, making your way off the platform toward what would certainly be your next big haul. "Come on, we can't keep Alex alone for too long."

"I think they'd quite enjoy the peace and quiet." Rhea piped up, following after you. 

Mora hopped down off the platform, and scampered to the front of the group. The three of you crossed though a set of city ruins, crumbling empy buildings, empty windows free of any glass. Rocks and rubble to climb over. And other than their occasionally faulty footsteps, the world was terribly silent.

They reached what must have been the city center, a large, cleared out rectangle, with a few mounds where buildings had been, worn away by countless years. A deep crack severed the area in nearly two perfect halves, the chasm fading into darkness fairly quickly.

You stop to marvel around you. Standing in the clearing, surrounded by former edifices, now leaning against the wind, a literal fraction of what they once were. You then bring out your datapad, with copies of the scans from [[The Opal Star|your ship]], and attempt to triangulate the position of this trove.

> Up next: finding the thing in the decrepit castle. It ends up being a large artifact. Perhaps a statue. This is basically set in Central part, the castle is Belvedere Castle. Would be funny if the statue was the Wall Stree Bull, but it could be something else that isn't actually related to the real world. Also this version of NYC could be a replica built on another planet, since Earth kind of feels endgame-y for these folks.
> Also "You" is Caleb, but I wanted to play with second person. Caleb could also be a default name for the PC. Would also involve pronoun switching in a lot of places.
