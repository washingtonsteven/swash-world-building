# Strategy

Caleb punched up the video call, and used the short connection time to reach behind him for a crunchy snack to have during the Caravan meeting. Hm. [[Joyride crunchy snack]]. That'll have to do.

He wiggled his fingers, stretching a long as he could to get at the tantalizing bag of crisps. His tail was wavering, attempting to counter balance, when the char arm he was leaning on suddenly _snapped_, sending him crashing toward the floor, his face making a few stops on the metal shelves along the way.

"Gah! Shit..." he moaned, now covered in in a small avalanche of souvenirs and tools. Luckily the heavy and sharp stuff were properly wrapped up in cushioned storage, so there would only be a few bruises this time. With a huff, he snatched the bag and slumped in his chair, poking at the destroyed arm, hanging on to the rest of the seat by a thin strip of metal. "That'll be a good chunk of the next haul." he thought.

"Graceful." Sodim's rough voice came in over the comms. Of course he was on first. "Graceful as a--"

Caleb cut him off. "I know, I know haha laugh at the nerd who can't get a snack without ruining shit."

Sodim grunted. "You know it's less fun when you play the self-pity card."

Rhea logged in, she adjusted the focus on her camera as she waved silently. Caleb responded with his own wave at Rhea while continuing the conversation with Sodim. "That's why I'm so damn good at it. Who wouldn't have mercy on pitiful, old me."

Mora signed on, fiddling with her headset. Her refusal of comm implants always made these calls awkward. It was better when they regrouped on a world before heading off into the void.

"Okay." Her voice was full of static. The rest of the gang tried to get her to fix it, but she refused to follow directions. For an accomplished [[Joyride overarching ship name|skipper]] mechanic, she sure refused to work with any other technology. "So, how is everyone doing?"

A mumbled chorus of "good," "ehh," and a tired look from Sodim crackled over the comms. A beep and the last member of the [[Thylacine Harpy Caravan]], Alex, popped into the grid.

"Hi!" Alex was beaming. Their normally grayish-blue skin was tinted pink in their cheeks, and there was a sparkle in their eyes that no one else had after a week of staring at nothing but blackness. "I'm here!"

"So you are." Sodim grunted. He pressed a few buttons on his panel, and up popped a [[Bounty]], a file full of information on an extant, as-yet-unexplored planet, signed by the president of the [[Joyride Science Organization]]. "TK-421, codename _Hawkmoon_. It's a good size for us to be able to get a good chunk of the planet scanned before others get there, and it's only a few jumps away."

Mora nodded. "Not bad. I had that one as well. And a few others." A series of beeps and Caleb's vision was almost completely obscured by forcibly opened files. He scambled to minimize them, focusing on the last one sent. "MF-8008, no code name. Ooo mysterious!" he commented, mid bite. Flecks of crisp went everywhere.

Rhea winced. "Could you not?" she asked. "Or at least mute yourself while--"

"Done." Caleb muted, and obnoxiously shoved a fistful of crisps into his maw, chewing exaggeratedly, letting crispmush fly all over his screen. Rhea's disgust was palpable, even half a kilometer away.

Alex chimed in. "I uh...I didn't see any bounties I liked."

"Did you even look?" Sodim sighed.

"Well, uh, see I have, a friend, back home, and..."

Mora put up a paw. "We don't need the details. Just do your homework next time and do your part in this Caravan. Or I'll disable your warp drive and leave you for the [[Joyride mythical scary beast for children]]."

Alex straightened up. "Understood, ma'am."

Rhea brought up a graph. Caleb shook his head. Rhea was always about the graphs. Though he had to hand it to her, her ability to synthesize data had her on the level of some AIs out there. Maybe not quite, but very close. She was certainly the largest calculator that Caleb had ever seen.

"If size is the main issue, then any of these suggestions would do. They're all X-class. And should all be within jump range with how much fuel we have left."

Caleb put down the crisps, swallowed, and unmuted himself. "I'm getting kinda low. Maybe we can pick something near a fuel depot so you don't have to tug me."

"Really?" Mora asked. "We just filled up back on Therossae."

Caleb shrugged. "It's an old ship? Real fuel guzzler."

"I supposed. I'll take a look when we land next."

"If it's a dice roll." Sodim started. "Then I vote for mine." Silence. "Not just selfishly, but it's one of th closer ones, and a fuel depot should be floating by there by the time we get there. Jump in, fuel up, land, and scout."

Caleb nodded. "Sounds good to me."

Mora recalled her files. "Fine. Any objections?"

Silence and shrugs.

"Let get this motherfucker, then." despite the static, the sly smirk on the rasp of her voice transmitted to the rest of the Caravan loud and clear. "Mora, out."
