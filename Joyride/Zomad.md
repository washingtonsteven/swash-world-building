# Zomad

Bipedal plants with multiple arms, which they can grow at will. They move on mobile platforms while young, still growing roots. But eventually must be planted, preferably with their family or an adopted family, and join root systems for the rest of their lives. 

In Zomad legend, [[there is a planet|Zomad planet]] whose entire mass is made of up billions of Zomad with entagled roots. This planet is considered a sort of "Holy Grail" for finding it among its people.
