# Zomad

Bipedal plants, multiple arms, can grow sort of at will. Move on mobile platforms while young, still growing roots. But eventually must be planted, preferably with their family or an adopted family, and joi root systems for the rest of their lives. 

There is a planet that is actually just the accumulated mass of all of these people, still alive. Floating in space. I guess that means they can live in the vaccuum.
