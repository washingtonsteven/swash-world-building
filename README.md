This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault that contains notes on stories that I'm writing, in a pseudo-wiki format.

A nicer way to view this is at <https://swash-world-building.netlify.app>. The code for that site is available [on Github](https://github.com/washingtonsteven/gatsby-swash-world-building)

I'll get around to notating the rules for this vault here, particuarly rules that make the above site work (i.e. tagging and folder structure, file templates and layout, etc.)
