# APRIL

[[APRIL]] is an AI in charge of a rover on Mars. She works with [[Daria]], her human handler.

Eventually she discovers that she, and all AI on Earth, are actually children of the Last Thonic, a member of a nearly extinct race of energy beings living in Substrate, a silicon-like metal floating in space.
