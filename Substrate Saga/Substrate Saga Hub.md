# Substrate Saga

## Stories
- [[Trapped God]]
- [[Rover]]
- [[Thonic Princess]]

## Description

Also will make separate pages for these, but wanted to write them down:

- [[Thonic Princess]]
    - Bounty Hunter charged with getting a backup of a Thonic princess. They fall in love in the mean time.
      BH must go physically to not alert the network to the transfer. The Backup Keepers are supposedly loyal but when has that ever gone smoothly.
      BH and Princess escape but are stranded somewhere. Love blooms
- [[APRIL]] (a.k.a Rover)
    - APRIL is an AI in charge of a rover on Mars. She discovers the Last Thonic, slumbering within a silicon layer, and discovers that all AI that were supposedly a creation of humans are actually descended from Thonics, specifically the will of the Last Thonic. Where do her allegiances lie? How was she treated by humans, and her handler, Daria?
- [[Trapped God]]
    - Thonics living in an asteroid field have built a religion around one specific asteroid, which has been the source of their power and a lifeblood for them, allowing them to leave their substrates and advance beyond their wildest dreams. A (human? another Thonic? TBD) shows up, hearing the song from the heart of the asteroid, and learns the true secret of the source of the Thonics' power (hint, it's a trapped being forcibly harvested for their energy)
