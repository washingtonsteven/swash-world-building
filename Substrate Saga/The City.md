# The City
A Ruin deep in the center of the largest asteroid of the [[Floating Archipelago]].

I probably need a better name for this. More mystical or something?

Main city is centered on the worship of energy emanating from the center of a central asteroid. Architecture is very cathedral-like, taking cues from the Dreaming City.
