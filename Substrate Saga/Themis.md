# Themis

A Ruin deep in the center of the largest asteroid of the [[Floating Archipelago]].

Main city is centered on the worship of energy emanating from the center of a central asteroid. Architecture is very cathedral-like (i.e. Dreaming City).

## Name

From the titan [Themis][namesource]: "She was the human-like representation of the natural and moral order"
