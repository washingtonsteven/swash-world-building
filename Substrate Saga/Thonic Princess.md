<!-- from Notion -->
bounty hunter charged with getting a backup of a Thonic princess. She does and they fall in love. its weird cause shes a simulacrum

BH has to go physically so the transfer doesn't alert the network. the backup keepers are supposed to be loyal, but upon hearing of this they scheme to topple the monarchy. (maybe for good reason?)

they escape but BHs ship is damaged leaving them on a planet to survive. meet other cool alien characters. etc.
