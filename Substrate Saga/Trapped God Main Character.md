# Trapped God Main Character

I still don't have a name for this one. Rename this file when I get there.

##### Motivation
Discover what is drawing them to the center of the city, potentially finding a way home.

##### Visual Design
TBD. Some ideas:
- Human, 90s skater boy with shorts and an oversized hoodie. Otherwise blank expression.
- Some sort of alien?

##### Abilities
- Moving and Jumping.
- Hookshot ability.
- Other movement abilities?
- Innate connection with the cosmic energy flowing through the Floating Archipelago.
